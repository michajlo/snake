This code is neither pretty nor heavily tested, but it's great for killing time.

list.c/.h are very general implementations I created back in school, so a lot of the code probably isn't used here.

I know curses could be used, but my goal was to get familiar with VT100 codes.  I may port it to curses later.

If the score is coming up within the bottom wall, then your terminal probably isn't big enough.

Possible improvements:
 - colors (I started to do this but couldn't settle on a color scheme)
 - signal handler to clear screen on exit
 - more configurability?

To change the speed edit the value passed to usleep (search for it, theres only one).

To change the size, change the #defines at the top of the file.

Share with friends and family, everyone gets bored.
